### **Site Aims:**
1. *Foster Community Engagement*: Create a vibrant and interactive platform where hikers of all levels can connect, share experiences, and support each other.

2. *Provide Comprehensive Trail Information*: Offer detailed and up-to-date information on hiking trails, including maps, difficulty ratings, directions, and user reviews, to help members plan their hikes effectively.

10. *Provide Support and Feedback Channels*: Ensure members can easily contact community organizers for support, ask questions, and provide feedback to continuously improve the website and communityÂ experience.

### **Wireframes:**
To organize my thoughts and prevent scope creep, I created wireframes for this project. Below are links to each of the mobile and desktop versions of the four intended pages. 

* Mobile Wireframes:
    * [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/index-mobile.png)
    * [Gallery page](docs/wireframes/gallery-mobile.png)
    * [Sign Up page](docs/wireframes/signup-mobile.png)
    * [About Us page](docs/wireframes/aboutus-mobile.png)

* Desktop wireframes:
    * [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/index-desktop.png)
    * [Gallery page](docs/wireframes/gallery-desktop.png)
    * [Sign Up page](docs/wireframes/signup-desktop.png)
    * [About Us page](docs/wireframes/aboutus-desktop.png)
  There was some deviation from the original wireframes to improve the User Experience (UX).

### **Color Scheme:**
When deciding the color scheme, I wanted to go with something that gave an elegant appearance. For this reason, I selected a range of blue and gold's and used the following color grid created on [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%230000001A%0D%0A%234c1a11%0D%0A%23C1CDBF%0D%0A%234a1111%0D%0A%23fafafa%0D%0A%23752323%0D%0A%233a3a3a%0D%0A%23f16c6b%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast scores. Using this grid allowed me to ensure all text remained visible and the site was accessible to all.

## **Current Features Common to all pages**
###  **Header Element**
The header element sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls up and down. Originally I had designed the page with a "return to top" link at the bottom of the page. However, a Code Institute graduate pointed out that the sticky header would provide a more pleasant UX and adhere to popular conventions better. The header itself contains the following features: 

#### *Title:*
![Page title](docs/screenshots/title.png)

* The title serves to state the name of the community.
* It also serves as a navigation link to the home page as per the well-established convention expected by the user.

#### *Navigation Bar:*
* The navigation bar appears on all four pages (including the form feedback page). 
* It contains links to the home, gallery,sign up, and about us page to allow easy navigation around the website. 
* The below image shows the user's current page highlighted in blue with a white border.

## **Footer**
* The footer includes direct links to all  social media accounts.

* These icons were imported from font awesome at the bottom of the page. 
![Page footer](docs/screenshots/footer.png)


## **Typography**
* Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:
  * Lato sans-serif - For the title to give it a strong presence.
  * Lato sans-serif - For all other headings including the navbar. 
  * Oswald sans-serif - for all content text.

* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

### **Form Feedback Page Content**
* I created this page to mimic the effect of actually submitting a form. 
* I centered the text alignment on this page only. I set the text-alignment property to "justify" on smaller screen widths and to "left" on larger screens for all other pages. I made this decision because of the lack of text on the form feedback page. Matching the alignment to the other pages looked out of place.
* Since filling in the form suggests the user is interested in learning more, I have included a longer feature video about the tradition here. *Note: Originally, I had wanted to use this on the home page, but due to the length of the video, I deemed it too long for an introduction. There is no auto play on the videos, so the user can choose whether they want to engage with the video or not.*
* Link included within the content to take the user back to the initial contact page, in case they wanted to look at the ways to contact a local meditation center, send an additional message, or sign up to the mailing list.

![Form feedback content](docs/screenshots/form-feedback-content.jpg)

## **Future-Enhancements**

* The future intention of the site would be to serve as a website specifically for Malta, where there is no community until now. However, Due to the summer break, which the tradition undergoes every year, I could not reach the traditions director with my request for permission. I decided to build a tribute site to showcase to the head office and adapt the content to be more Malta specific later on. 

* At first, the purpose would remain to educate and raise awareness meaning the current content would still be applicable; however, There would be additional content I could add as interest grew. Such things would be: -

    * Times/dates/venues for Meetups in Malta to build a community
    * Times/dates/venues for Book clubs to study and discuss the materials and methods to apply them to daily life.
    * More information on the lineage of the tradition to include short biographies.

* Eventually, when Malta was designated a teacher by the head office, these would then convert into: -

    * Times/dates/venues/fees for Formal classes
    * Times/dates/venues/fees for Public talks/events
    * Include a bio for Malta's officially designated teacher at the end of the traditions lineage page or add a new page summarizing their experience.

* Once I better understand Javascript, I would like to add a burger menu for mobile-sized device screens. I found articles on achieving this with CSS and HTML alone; however, I did not deem this necessary to create the minimum viable product, which is this project.

* I would also make the contact form fully function with a post request and have a database to collate data for the mailing list.
