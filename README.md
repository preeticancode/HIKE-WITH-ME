### **Wireframes:**
To organize my thoughts and prevent scope creep, I created wireframes for this project. Below are links to each of the mobile and desktop versions of the four intended pages. 

* Mobile Wireframes:
    * [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/index-mobile.png)
    * [Gallery page](docs/wireframes/gallery-mobile.png)
    * [Sign Up page](docs/wireframes/signup-mobile.png)
    * [About Us page](docs/wireframes/aboutus-mobile.png)

* Desktop wireframes:
    * [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/index-desktop.png)
    * [Gallery page](docs/wireframes/gallery-desktop.png)
    * [Sign Up page](docs/wireframes/signup-desktop.png)
    * [About Us page](docs/wireframes/aboutus-desktop.png)
  There was some deviation from the original wireframes to improve the User Experience (UX).

### **Color Scheme:**
When deciding the color scheme, I wanted to go with something that gave an elegant appearance. For this reason, I selected a range of blue and gold's and used the following color grid created on [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%230000001A%0D%0A%234c1a11%0D%0A%23C1CDBF%0D%0A%234a1111%0D%0A%23fafafa%0D%0A%23752323%0D%0A%233a3a3a%0D%0A%23f16c6b%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast scores. Using this grid allowed me to ensure all text remained visible and the site was accessible to all.

## **Current Features Common to all pages**
###  **Header Element**
The header element sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls up and down. Originally I had designed the page with a "return to top" link at the bottom of the page. However, a Code Institute graduate pointed out that the sticky header would provide a more pleasant UX and adhere to popular conventions better. The header itself contains the following features: 

#### *Title:*
![Page title](docs/screenshots/title.png)

* The title serves to state the name of the community.
* It also serves as a navigation link to the home page as per the well-established convention expected by the user.

#### *Navigation Bar:*
* The navigation bar appears on all four pages (including the form feedback page). 
* It contains links to the home, gallery,sign up, and about us page to allow easy navigation around the website. 
* The below image shows the user's current page highlighted in blue with a white border.

![Page footer](docs/screenshots/footer.png)


## **Typography**

  * Lato sans-serif - For the title to give it a strong presence.
  * Lato sans-serif - For all other headings including the navbar. 
  * Oswald sans-serif - for all content text.

* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
